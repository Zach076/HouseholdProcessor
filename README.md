## Getting Started

Welcome to the HouseholdProcessor repo!

You should find the latest stable release on the github page at https://github.com/Zach076/HouseholdProcessor/releases/tag/Executable
Where there are directions on how to run the executable.

## Overview

This repo maintains an executable which takes input of peoples names, addresses, and ages. 
The program will display each household address and number of residents before displaying the residents' names, addresses, and ages if they are over the age of 18.

## Input

This program will accept arguments of paths to files containing data in the following format:

"firstName","lastName","streetAddress","city","state","age"
"firstName","lastName","streetAddress","city","state","age"
"firstName","lastName","streetAddress","city","state","age"
...

Where the age must be written numerically.
